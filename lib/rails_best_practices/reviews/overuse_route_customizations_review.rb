    # Implementation:
    #
    # Review process:
    #   the check methods are different for rails2 and rails3 syntax.
    #
    #   for rails2
    #
    #   check all command_call nodes in route file.
    #   if the message of command_call node is resources,
    #   and the second argument of command_call node is a hash,
    #   and the count of the pair (key/value) in hash is greater than @customize_count,
    #   then these custom routes are overuse.
    #
    #   for rails3
    #
    #   check all method_add_block nodes in route file.
    #   if the receiver of method_add_block node is with message resources,
    #   and in the block body of method_add_block node, there are more than @customize_count command nodes,
    #   whose message is get, post, update or delete,
    #   then these custom routes are overuse.
