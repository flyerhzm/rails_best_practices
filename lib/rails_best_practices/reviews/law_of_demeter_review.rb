    # Implementation:
    #
    # Review process:
    #   check all method calls to see if there is method call to the association object.
    #   if there is a call node whose receiver is an object of model (compare by name),
    #   and whose message is an association of that model (also compare by name),
    #   and outer the call node, it is also a call node,
    #   then it violate the law of demeter.
