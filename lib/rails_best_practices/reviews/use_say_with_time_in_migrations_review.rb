    # Implementation:
    #
    # Review process:
    #   check class method define nodes (self.up or self.down).
    #   if there is a method call in the class method definition,
    #   and the message of method call is not say, say_with_time and default migration methods
    #   (such as add_column and create_table), then the method call should be wrapped by say or say_with_time.
