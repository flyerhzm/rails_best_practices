    # See the best practice details here http://rails-bestpractices.com/posts/3-use-scope-access.

    # Implementation:
    #
    # Review process:
    #   check all if nodes to see
    #
    #   if they are compared with current_user or current_user.id,
    #   and there is redirect_to method call in if block body,
    #   then it should be replaced by using scope access.
