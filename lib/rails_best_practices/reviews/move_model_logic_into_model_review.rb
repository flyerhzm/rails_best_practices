    # Review a controller file to make sure that complex model logic should not exist in controller, should be moved into a model.

    # Implementation:
    #
    # Review process:
    #   check all method defines in the controller files,
    #   if there are multiple method calls apply to one receiver,
    #   and the receiver is a variable,
    #   then they are complex model logic, and they should be moved into model.
